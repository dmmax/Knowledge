## Tiramisu ingredients
1. Yolks – 5 pieces
2. Mascarpone – 250g

## Tiramisu steps
1. Prepare coffee and add alcohol (optional)
2. Regularly mix Yolks with Icing sugar on a steam bath until it has 60 degree
3. When it has enough temperature, take off from the steam bath and use a mixer
   with mid-level speed to make it light airy texture (for me it takes about 15
     minutes)
4. Now,  need to add Mascarpone to the container with Yolks and Icing sugar and
   mix it until common texture. Your sauce is ready
5. The next step will be to add to the form Savoiardi and sauce: each ladyfinger
   put into the coffee for 1-2 seconds and move to the form, repeat it until
   you have a full layer of Savoiardi. On top of it add the sauce as a second
   layer. Add one more layer with Savoiardi and sauce
6. So, now you need to put your form into the refrigerator for 10-12 hours
7. After refrigerator you need use sieve to add Cocoa powder to the form as last
   layer
8. Your cake is ready ;)
