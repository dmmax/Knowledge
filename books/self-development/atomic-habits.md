# Book: Atomic Habits

Author: James Clear

## TL;DR

* *Form a habit in a loop* – reminder -> routine -> reward -> reminder
* *Make it obvious* – Set a specific time and place. Or tie the new habit to an old habit
* *Make It Attractive* – Bundle fun stuff with new habits
* *Make it easy* – Start habits with small things
* *Make It Satisfying* – Reward yourself after you finish
* *Make it trackable* – to see progress over time, use a tracker

## The imact of small habits
We could have bad and good small habits, and in short term, we will not see any  
changes in our lives, but in the long-term it could have a significant impact.

Bad habits:
- Eat family-size pizza each day
- Overwork each day

Good habits:
- Invest 10% of your salary
- Walking for 20-30 minutes per day
- Do morning exercise

## How are habits formed?

1. Reminder. The cue or trigger that starts the habit
2. Routine. The action you take. The habit itself.
3. Reward. The benefit you gain from doing the habit.
4. Repeat

Repeat, repeat, and repeat.

## Hard-to-miss cues and a plan of action

* Need to change an environment to make habits more obvious
  * Example: Want to do yoga in the morning? Put a yoga mat in the center of
    your room before sleep
* Make clean a plan of action: when, what, and where you will do it. The formula
  is pretty simple
  * I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]

## Making habits attractive

Reward yourself to make unattractive actions enjoyable

## Building new habits

Make good habits as easiest as possible.
Examples: read two pages before sleep

Make bad habits as hard to be completed as possible.
Example: if you want to watch less TV, unplug  it and take the batteries out of
the remote

## Making habits immediately satisfying

Quote from the book
> What is immediately rewarded is repeated. What is immediately punished is
  avoided.

Reward yourself immediately after completing your new habit.

## Create a framework using trackers and contracts

For looking back and improving your motivation – you need to use some easy way
how to track your progress. For that purpose, I started to use the Streaks app.

Another improvement that you can do is to make a contract with someone close to
you.

E.g. you smoke, and want to drop this bad habit, you can make an agreement with
your wife/children/parents if you will smoke a cigarette, you will pay them $100
each for one cigarette
