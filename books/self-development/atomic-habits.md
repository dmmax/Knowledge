# Book: Atomic Habits

Author: James Clear

## The imact of small habits
We could have bad and good small habits, and in short term we will not see any  
changes for our life, but in long-term it could have significant impact.

Bad habits:
- Eat family-size pizza each day
- Overwork each day

Good habits:
- Invest 10% of your salary
- Walking for 20-30 minutes per day
- Do morning exercise

## How are habits formed?

1. Reminder. The cue or trigger that starts the habit
2. Routine. The action you take. The habit itself.
3. Reward. The benefit you gain from doing the habit.
4. Repeat

Repeat, repeat, and repeat.

## Hard-to-miss cues and a plan of action

* Need to change an environment to make cur more obvious
  * Example: Want to do yoga in the morning? Put a yoga mat in the center of
    your room before sleep
* Make clean a plan of action: when, what and how you will do it
  * Example: When you wake up â€“ the first thing you will do is yoga to watch
    video X which has length of Y minutes

## Building new habits

Make good habits as easiest as possible.

the remote
