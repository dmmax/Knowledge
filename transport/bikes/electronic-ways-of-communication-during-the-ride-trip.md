# Electronic ways of communication

I started to think about this topic when my wife and I went on a bike trip and during the journey, we want to keep communicating with each
other. So, how to achieve this? When we ride on a wide road - it is easy we can ride in parallel and communicate easily but it doesn't work
for most of the cases and we have to ride in a sequence.

The first thing I had in my mind is having wire headsets and calling in Telegram (or any other messengers). But this approach has cons and
pros.
Pros:

* Easy to install
* Do not need to spend additional money to buy new devices

Cons:

* Battery consumption â€“ I already use a lot a smartphone to use the map but it could be critical to add an always-on messenger on top of it
* Non-all zones are well covered by mobile network

The first thing I do when I don't from which point is to Google it and/or learn from others. Of course, the first thing I did is googling it
but after I decided to pick the second option as well and created a Reddit
topic: https://www.reddit.com/r/Brompton/comments/11uk3ab/best_way_to_communicate_with_each_other_on_road/. That was good that the same
question was already resolved by some persons.

Just to summarize the results of the discussion:
