# Zero inbox

## Purpose
To understand better, what are the current emails you need to work on.

## Pipeline
When you can see new e-mails in your box, you can define what it is a category
* Category 1: important and need to answer
* Category 2: important and need to keep [bills, copy of books, promo code, etc]
* Category 3: not important and need to answer in some time
* Category 4: not important and do not need to answer

Depending on each category you will need to do the next concrete action
* For Category 1: if the answer will take less than 2 minutes, just answer and
  if you do not need to await a response, archive the mail. If the answer will
  take a significant amount of time, then you need to keep it unread and add a
  task to your to-do list to answer ASAP.
* For Category 2: for emails that are needed for history, you need to move
  them in separate folders/categories with meaningful names. Use filters to
  move them automatically.
* For Category 3: if you can delegate this mail, just do it. Otherwise, you
  need to create one more task in your to-do list but probably with a lower
  priority than for Category 1.
* For Category 4: archive it immediately and if you have such emails on regular
  basis, create a filter to archive them automatically
