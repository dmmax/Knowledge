# Feedback

## SBI framework (Situation -> Behaviour -> Impact)

By using the SBI framework, the person giving feedback can provide specific and constructive feedback that helps the person receiving the
feedback understand the impact of their behaviour and how they can improve it in the future.
It is processing in 3 steps:
* the situation you saw
* the behavior (what the person did)
* the impact you observed
