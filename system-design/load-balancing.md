# Load balancing

The main purpose of load balancing is to optimize resource utilization, maximize throughput, minimize response time, and avoid overloading
any single resource.

## OSI L4 vs OSI L7 load balancing

L4 load balancing is focused on network-level traffic distribution, while L7 load balancing is focused on application-level traffic
distribution and can perform advanced functions such as SSL offloading, content-based routing, and application-layer security. L7 load
balancers are typically more feature-rich and complex than L4 load balancers, but may also be slower and more resource-intensive.
