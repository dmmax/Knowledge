# Internet in Germany

The internet in Germany is pretty stable except the codvid time because it has
had a lot of overloads. But at the same time it's pretty expensinve compare to
Russian internet providers ;)

For now I used two internet providers:

* Vodafone – it was pretty good but after 2 years I had to pay around 40 euros  
  per month and I decided to switch to another provider
* Telekom – it is my current provider and I would say it works the same as
  Vodafone but paying per month with all bonuses will be less than with Vodafone.
  Unfortunately, I faced an [ugly issue with installing my router](telekom-install-custom-router)
